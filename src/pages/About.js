      <h1> About Karma Kofi!</h1>
      <p>
        At Karma Kofi, we believe that every cup of coffee can make a positive
        impact on the world. We are more than just a caf√©; we are a community of
        like-minded individuals who come together to enjoy exceptional coffee
        while contributing to meaningful social causes. From sourcing our beans
        ethically to supporting local farmers and donating a portion of our
        proceeds to charitable initiatives, we strive to embody the spirit of
        good karma in everything we do.
